This is a 3D labirinth game, originally created as an undergraduate school project.

The program is standard C++ (CXX11) and depends on the following:
 - OpenGL (>=3.3)
 - GLEW, GLU
 - GLM (>=0.9.7)
 - SDL2 (>=2.0) with SDL2_image

On Windows you can find all dependencies correctly on my university's site: [Pack](http://cg.elte.hu/~bsc_cg/resources/OGLPack_VS2015.zip)
